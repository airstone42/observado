## Introduction

This is a simple GUI tool for chord detection developed from the example in [librosa.sequence.viterbi_discriminative](https://librosa.org/librosa/generated/librosa.sequence.viterbi_discriminative.html#librosa.sequence.viterbi_discriminative), with the ability to detect some seventh chords by using the k-NN algorithm.

The main idea is using the k-NN algorithm to tell some triads and sevenths chords apart after the result of ```librosa.sequence.viterbi_discriminative```. Chroma features of audio files generated by MIDI chord templates are used as the dataset.

This is only a project for my coursework which does not guarantee the accuracy. It would be better not to use it to do chord detection in practice.

## Requirements

- Timidity++
- Qt

### Python

- joblib
- librosa
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit_learn
- scipy
- tqdm

## Setup

First, install Python requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then generate data. It may take a while.

```bash
cd observado/
python generate.py
```

You may directly use ```main.py```, or build the GUI tool with CMake.
