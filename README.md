## Introduction

This is a simple project developed from the example in [librosa.sequence.viterbi_discriminative](https://librosa.org/librosa/generated/librosa.sequence.viterbi_discriminative.html#librosa.sequence.viterbi_discriminative), with the ability to detect some seventh chords by the k-NN algorithm and a GUI.

The main idea is using the k-NN algorithm to tell some triads and sevenths chords apart after the result of ```librosa.sequence.viterbi_discriminative```. Chroma features of audio files generated by MIDI chord templates are used as the dataset.

This is only a project for my coursework without accuracy. It would be better not to use it to do chord detection in practice.
